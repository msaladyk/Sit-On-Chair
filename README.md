# Sit-On-Chair
This is my first landing page. It was the final task of the first module on a course I took at Coders Lab.

The idea was to create a landing page basing on the knowledge acquired during the first module (HTML and CSS). I tried to use a little bit of everything I learned so far + some additional features I came up with myself. The layout has been defined in an enclosed picture below.
